# Push to GitHub - Authentication Required

Your Strava Stats application is ready to push, but GitHub requires authentication. Here are your options:

## ✅ Repository Setup Complete
- Remote added: `https://github.com/arun-gupta/strava-stats.git`
- Branch renamed to `main`
- All commits ready to push

## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "Strava Stats App"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

2. **Push with token:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arungupta/strava-stats
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - When prompted for username: enter your GitHub username
   - When prompted for password: paste your Personal Access Token

### Option 2: SSH Key Setup

1. **Generate SSH key:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   - Copy the output
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste the key and save

3. **Change remote to SSH:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arungupta/strava-stats
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:arun-gupta/strava-stats.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push
cd /Users/arungupta/strava-stats
git push -u origin main
```
