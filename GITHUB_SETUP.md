# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your Strava Stats application is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `strava-stats`
   - Description: `Python Flask web application for Strava activity analytics with interactive charts, calorie tracking, and heart rate zone analysis`
   - Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Copy the repository URL** (it will look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/strava-stats.git`)

4. **Run these commands in your terminal:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arungupta/strava-stats
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/strava-stats.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
cd /Users/arungupta/strava-stats
gh repo create strava-stats --public --description "Python Flask web application for Strava activity analytics" --push
```

## What's Already Done ✅

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added and committed
- ✅ .gitignore configured (excludes .env, venv/, etc.)
- ✅ Git user configuration set up
- ✅ Initial commit created with descriptive message

## Repository Contents

Your repository will include:
- 📱 Complete Flask web application
- 🐍 Virtual environment setup scripts
- 📊 Interactive data visualization
- 🔐 Secure OAuth integration
- 📖 Comprehensive documentation
- ⚙️ Environment configuration templates

## After Pushing to GitHub

1. **Update your email** in Git config if needed:
   ```bash
   git config user.email "your-actual-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** on any new deployment by copying `.env.example` to `.env`

3. **Share your repository** with others or deploy to platforms like Heroku, Railway, or Vercel

## Security Note 🔒

The `.env` file (containing your Strava API keys) is already excluded from Git via `.gitignore`. Your sensitive credentials will NOT be pushed to GitHub.

---

**Ready to push!** Just create the GitHub repository and run the commands above.
